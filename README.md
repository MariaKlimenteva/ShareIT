# ShareIT
---
An application that allows users to share data.

---
The project has several logical parts: the connection between users using boost asio (the basis is transmission via tcp v4) and the visual component using Qt.

#### How to build
You can build a project simply by running CmakeLists.txt (boost will be installed automatically using a script check_lib.sh which is related to CMakeLists.txt)
